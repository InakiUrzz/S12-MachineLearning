## Notebook
This notebook is divided into two parts. The first one, where we will develop a predictive classification model within a Pipeline and then we will modify its hyperparameters with the Grid Search Technique.
The second part consists of a sentiment analysis where we count the frequency with which words are repeated given the text we pass to it (Data Science Definition). Finally we will plot them on a Bar chart and a Cloud Chart.
